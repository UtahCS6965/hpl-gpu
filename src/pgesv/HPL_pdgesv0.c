/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_pdgesv0 factors a N+1-by-N matrix using LU factorization with row
 * partial pivoting.  The main algorithm  is the "right looking" variant
 * without look-ahead. The lower triangular factor is left unpivoted and
 * the pivots are not returned. The right hand side is the N+1 column of
 * the coefficient matrix.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * GRID    (local input)                 HPL_T_grid *
 *         On entry,  GRID  points  to the data structure containing the
 *         process grid information.
 *
 * ALGO    (global input)                HPL_T_palg *
 *         On entry,  ALGO  points to  the data structure containing the
 *         algorithmic parameters.
 *
 * A       (local input/output)          HPL_T_pmat *
 *         On entry, A points to the data structure containing the local
 *         array information.
