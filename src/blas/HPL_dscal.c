 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_dscal scales the vector x by alpha.
 * 
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * N       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, N specifies the length of the vector x. N  must  be
 *         at least zero.
 *
 * ALPHA   (local input)                 const double
 *         On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
 *         supplied as zero, then the entries of the incremented array X
 *         need not be set on input.
 *
 * X       (local input/output)          double *
 *         On entry,  X  is an incremented array of dimension  at  least
 *         ( 1 + ( n - 1 ) * abs( INCX ) )  that  contains the vector x.
 *         On exit, the entries of the incremented array  X  are  scaled
 *         by the scalar alpha.
 *
 * INCX    (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of X.
 *         INCX must not be zero.
