/* 
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_dgemm performs one of the matrix-matrix operations
 *  
 *     C := alpha * op( A ) * op( B ) + beta * C
 *  
 *  where op( X ) is one of
 *  
 *     op( X ) = X   or   op( X ) = X^T.
 *  
 * Alpha and beta are scalars,  and A,  B and C are matrices, with op(A)
 * an m by k matrix, op(B) a k by n matrix and  C an m by n matrix.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *

 *         as follows:                                                  
 *            ORDER = HplRowMajor,

 *
 * TRANSA  (local input)                 const enum HPL_TRANS
 *         On entry, TRANSA  specifies the form of  op(A)  to be used in
 *         the matrix-matrix operation follows:                         
 *            TRANSA==HplNoTrans    : op( A ) = A,                     
 *            TRANSA==HplTrans      : op( A ) = A^T,                   
 *            TRANSA==HplConjTrans  : op( A ) = A^T.                   
 *
 * TRANSB  (local input)                 const enum HPL_TRANS
 *         On entry, TRANSB  specifies the form of  op(B)  to be used in
 *         the matrix-matrix operation follows:                         
 *            TRANSB==HplNoTrans    : op( B ) = B,                     
 *            TRANSB==HplTrans      : op( B ) = B^T,                   
 *            TRANSB==HplConjTrans  : op( B ) = B^T.                   
 *
 * M       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  M  specifies  the  number  of rows  of the  matrix
 *         op(A)  and  of  the  matrix  C.  M  must  be  at least  zero.
 *
 * N       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  N  specifies  the number  of columns of the matrix
 *         op(B)  and  the number of columns of the matrix  C. N must be
 *         at least zero.
 *
 * K       (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry,  K  specifies  the  number of columns of the matrix
 *         op(A) and the number of rows of the matrix op(B).  K  must be
 *         be at least  zero.
 *
 * ALPHA   (local input)                 const double
 *         On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   When  ALPHA  is
 *         supplied  as  zero  then the elements of the matrices A and B
 *         need not be set on input.
 *
 * A       (local input)                 const double *
 *         On entry,  A  is an array of dimension (LDA,ka),  where ka is
 *         k  when   TRANSA==HplNoTrans,  and  is  m  otherwise.  Before
 *         entry  with  TRANSA==HplNoTrans, the  leading  m by k part of
 *         the array  A must contain the matrix A, otherwise the leading
 *         k  by  m  part of the array  A  must  contain the  matrix  A.
 *
 * LDA     (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, LDA  specifies the first dimension of A as declared
 *         in the  calling (sub) program. When  TRANSA==HplNoTrans  then
 *         LDA must be at least max(1,m), otherwise LDA must be at least
 *         max(1,k).
 *
 * B       (local input)                 const double *
 *         On entry, B is an array of dimension (LDB,kb),  where  kb  is
 *         n   when  TRANSB==HplNoTrans, and  is  k  otherwise.   Before
 *         entry with TRANSB==HplNoTrans,  the  leading  k by n  part of
 *         the array  B must contain the matrix B, otherwise the leading
 *         n  by  k  part of the array  B  must  contain  the matrix  B.
 *
 * LDB     (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, LDB  specifies the first dimension of B as declared
 *         in the  calling (sub) program. When  TRANSB==HplNoTrans  then
 *         LDB must be at least max(1,k), otherwise LDB must be at least
 *         max(1,n).
 *
 * BETA    (local input)                 const double
 *         On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.   When  BETA  is
 *         supplied  as  zero  then  the  elements of the matrix C  need
 *         not be set on input.
 *
 * C       (local input/output)          double *
 *         On entry,  C  is an array of dimension (LDC,n). Before entry,
 *         the  leading m by n part  of  the  array  C  must contain the
 *         matrix C,  except when beta is zero, in which case C need not
 *         be set on entry. On exit, the array  C  is overwritten by the
 *         m by n  matrix ( alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C ).
 *
 * LDC     (local input)                 const int
 *         On entry, LDC  specifies the first dimension of C as declared
 *         in  the   calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
 *         max(1,m).
