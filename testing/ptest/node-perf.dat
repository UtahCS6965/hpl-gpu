#Define relative performance per node
#Relative performance must be between 0.01 and 1.0
#e.g.
#localhost 0.5
#fasthost 1.0
#
#Can also identify an MPIrank by /rank
#e.g.
#/0 0.5
#/1 1.0
#
#The first match is used
#
#Each process columns is assigned the performance of the slowest node belonging to it.
#Thus, it is suggested to order the nodes by performance and use colmajor process ordering.
